\section{Introduction}

Asynchronous audio communication (AAC) is rapidly becoming available to general users of technology. 
While text is still by far the most prevalent mode of communication on the Internet, social platforms such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook provide the option to record audio-only messages in addition to text, photo, and video. 
Audio is desirable in such situations because it allows users to deliver more expressive, nuanced messages.

AAC holds considerable potential for more specialized settings as well, namely collaboration for education and business. 
For instance, audio messages have been favorably used to disseminate feedback on assignments in online education courses \cite{ice,oomen}. 
On the other hand, voice communication is much less prevalent in business environments; the predominant manifestation of audio-only communication has been voicemail, a paradigm that is on the decline and generally regarded as ``onerous'' and ``laborious'' \cite{whittaker}. 
According to Grudin \cite{grudin}, the primary reason for this failure of voicemail is an imbalance of work between speaker and listener: message creators are afforded the convenience of rapid production, while listeners are often faced with a bevy of voice messages which must be processed essentially at the original rate of speech. 
Perhaps for this reason, email continues to predominate over voice messages in corporate communication despite the diminished individuality and, more critically, the higher risk of miscommunication in textual media \cite{byron}.

Despite the difficulties that Grudin points out, AAC would undoubtedly be superior to text in certain contexts. 
For instance, audio messages could be used in online courses to improve student-student and student-instructor engagement and a sense of the instructor's social presence \cite{oomen,tu}. 
Another area of benefit would be in document-based collaboration, in which voice annotations would be uniquely capable of allowing the user to consume others' comments aurally without distracting the user visually \cite{yoon}.

This paper seeks to address the current problems of AAC by means of a user-friendly tool, which we call SimpleSpeech, for audio production in a discussion setting. 
While solutions to the issue of imbalance between speaker and listener have been developed in prior studies, the authors feel that the significant advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) in recent years \cite{baker} have created new areas of potential improvement. 
Recording and editing voice messages in a web browser is now entirely practical, and ASR error rates are low enough that text can be used as a proxy for editing audio at the word level.
Furthermore, the preliminary tests conducted in this study revealed a hitherto unexplored consequence of AAC, namely an elevated level of mental workload while recording one's voice. 
This effect was investigated quantitatively to assess its possible impact on the viability of AAC, especially in educational contexts. 

The structure of the paper is as follows: first, earlier works that have attempted to resolve problems with AAC are discussed. Next, we present the design and implementation of SimpleSpeech, as well as the qualitative evaluation study we conducted to generate implications for AAC in general. Finally, the workload and linguistic formality of voice messages produced using SimpleSpeech is investigated, providing insight into future applications of AAC for online collaboration.

\section{Related Work}
Past approaches to combined audio and text modalities have their origin in voicemail systems, which exemplify the imbalance between audio production and consumption. 
To remedy this, Whittaker et al. \cite{whittaker} attempted to create a more balanced, usable system by converting the audio messages into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR). 
In that study, the combination of text and audio was considerably more appealing to listeners since it allowed them to extract information from messages more efficiently. 
Most studies have utilized ASR to produce the textual representation of speech since the technique became feasibly accurate.

Other related techniques for audio communication can be found in systems developed for document-based collaboration. 
Elaborating on the findings of earlier platforms for multimedia annotation \cite{bargeron}, for example, an application called RichReview developed by Yoon et al. \cite{yoon} facilitates discussions over PDF documents via text, audio, or handwriting annotations. 
An asynchronous audio solution for these document-based scenarios is especially relevant since it would allow commentators to have richer discussions over the document material without visually distracting from the original content. 

In addition to increasing the efficiency of audio consumption, ASR can also be used to facilitate speech editing. 
Phoneme alignment algorithms based on hidden Markov models, such as the Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner \cite{p2fa}, enable the persistent synchronization of audio and text representations as they are manipulated. 
Creating effective user interface paradigms that synthesize these two modalities, however, is a challenge that has been addressed mostly in dedicated audio and video editing software. 
For instance, a video editor developed by Casares et al. \cite{casares} enables the user to edit either the audio track or its transcript, with changes in one mode reflected in the other. 
A similar approach was utilized by Rubin et al. \cite{rubin}, who recently created a text-based editor for ``audio stories'' containing both speech and music.

In software targeted for non-professional users, Whittaker and Amento \cite{whittaker_semantic} developed a "semantic speech editor" in which the sole means of editing was through the transcription. 
They found that using the transcription as a proxy for audio editing was faster and produced better-quality revisions than audio-only modes, noting that the ability to scan quickly for regions requiring editing obviated the need for repeated playback. 
On the other hand, the ASR in their 2004 study suffered from a 28\% error rate; today's language models permit considerably greater accuracy, resulting in potentially even easier and faster audio editing.


\section{Software Design}
Building on the capabilities developed in these prior studies, SimpleSpeech is a web-based graphical interface for recording and editing short voice messages in a discussion setting.
Our design goals were as follows: to utilize live ASR transcription to assist in speech editing, to enable easy audio manipulation on the word level, and to add the more complex features on a tiered basis through modes and quasi-modes.
The appearance of the final SimpleSpeech user interface (UI) is shown in Fig. WHAT.

There are a wide variety of approaches to audio editing, ranging from waveform-only interfaces such as Audacity and Adobe Audition to "semantic speech editors" \cite{whittaker_semantic} which show only a transcript. 
For SimpleSpeech, we decided to adopt an editing paradigm similar to the latter, allowing the user to edit a textual representation which was time-aligned with the audio.
This choice was made for two reasons: (1) in general, users are much more familiar with text than with waveform editing; and (2) representing the audio as text would greatly increase the efficiency of editing speech on the word level, in contrast to the greater complexity of millisecond-level waveform operations. 

Accordingly, the UI for SimpleSpeech devotes the majority of the editing panel to the transcription. 
Users interact with the text by selecting, editing, and deleting tokens, which are colored blue for recognized words and green for pauses and unrecognized sounds. 
In addition to deletion using the Backspace key, green pause tokens can be inserted or extended using the space bar.
Deleting and inserting tokens results in the appropriate modifications to the working audio file.

We did choose to include a waveform visualization as part of the UI, though it serves only the auxiliary purpose of reinforcing to the user that he or she is ultimately manipulating audio, not text. The waveform incorporates several subtle indications of the mapping between its contents and the transcription:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The waveform for the line of text currently containing the caret is rendered.
	\item The time-aligned word boundaries are displayed as vertical lines.
	\item If one or more tokens are selected, the audio segment corresponding to the selection is highlighted.
	\item Deletions and pause insertions are visualized through a collapse/expand animation.
\end{itemize}
We found the presence of a waveform to be an important visual indicator of the purpose of SimpleSpeech.
Without the waveform, users' inclination was to disregard the original speech and use the system as a dictation tool.

\subsection{Simplification through Modes and Quasi-Modes}
Our use of text as a proxy for editing audio rendered it necessary to clearly delineate the capabilities of SimpleSpeech in comparison to a word processor.
For instace, direct text input is disallowed in the transcript area to avoid inserting words not present in the original recording.
To keep the behavior consistent, then, keyboard input is entirely disabled except for deletion and pause insertion.
However, we found the capability to edit the transcription to be desirable, especially if both audio and text representations were to be viewed by the message recipients.
To avoid interfering with token insertion and deletion, this transcription editing functionality is available in a separate mode, accessed by pressing the Return key. 

Another issue for experienced users that we identified in pilot testing was in quickly playing back and pausing the audio, since the conventional keyboard shortcut for playback, the spacebar, was already in use for the pause insertion feature.
We resolved this problem by using Shift+space for playing and pausing.
In effect, the playback functionality was encapsulated as a \emph{quasi-mode}, a set of distinct features that are accessed while performing a constant action (in this case, pressing the Shift key) \cite{raskin}. 
The modal design helps prevent basic or beginning users from being visually overwhelmed, while allowing more advanced users rapid access to the higher-level features.

\subsection{Implementation}
Our text-based approach requires a reliable transcription as well as time intervals corresponding to each word, both of which are generated by the IBM Watson Developer Cloud speech-to-text transcription service.
The web application, written in JavaScript, communicates through a web socket with the IBM server for transcription but performs all editing locally.
Internally, SimpleSpeech maintains a data model consisting of one or more user-created audio resources as well as a list of timestamps, where each timestamp links a token in the text area to a specific time interval within an audio resource. 
When the user plays back the message, the data model ``renders'' a complete audio recording by stitching together the audio from each timestamp. 

\section{Qualitative Evaluation}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of Author Keywords and ACM Classification
Keywords. The abstract and keywords should be placed in the left
column of the first page under the left half of the title. The
abstract should be a concise statement of the problem, approach, and
conclusions of the work described. It should clearly state the paper's
contribution to the field of HCI\@.

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold,
all in capitals. Sections should \textit{not} be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold
with initial letters capitalized.  For sub-sections and
sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of} is not
capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point
italic with initial letters capitalized.  Standard
\texttt{{\textbackslash}section}, \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsection},
and \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsubsection} commands will work fine in
this template.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

\begin{figure*}

    both columns. Note that \LaTeX\ tends to render large figures on a
    dedicated page. Image: \ccbynd~ayman on
    Flickr.}~\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure*}

Captions should be Times New Roman or Times Roman 9-point bold.  They
should be numbered (e.g., ``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or
``Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}''), centered and placed beneath the figure
or table.  Please note that the words ``Figure'' and ``Table'' should
be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure'' rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they
occur. Figures, like Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, may span columns and
all figures should also include alt text for improved accessibility.
Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in
the proceedings.

The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure up to five
minutes in length. However, the paper should stand on its own without
the video figure, as the video may not be available to everyone who
reads the paper.  

\subsection{Inserting Images}
When possible, include a vector formatted graphic (i.e. PDF or EPS).
When including bitmaps,  use an image editing tool to resize the image
at the appropriate printing resolution (usually 300 dpi).

\section{Language, Style and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consis- tently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy\~{\^{e}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Add tags to the PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see: \url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}.  The
\texttt{{\textbackslash}hyperref} package allows you to create well tagged PDF files,
please see the preamble of this template for an example.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission should not contain footer or header information
at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, your final submission
should not include page numbers. Initial submissions may include page
numbers, but these must be removed for camera-ready. Page numbers will
be added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

When creating your PDF from Word, ensure that you generate a tagged
PDF from improved accessibility. This can be done by using the Adobe
PDF add-in, also called PDFMaker. Select Acrobat | Preferences from
the ribbon and ensure that ``Enable Accessibility and Reflow with
tagged Adobe PDF'' is selected. You can then generate a tagged PDF by
selecting ``Create PDF'' from the Acrobat ribbon.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years’ proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.
