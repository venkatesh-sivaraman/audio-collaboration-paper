\begin{abstract}
  % Added a place-holder abstract, just so we have something to work
  % from
%  We present a novice-friendly system for construction of
%  high-quality audio narration. Unedited audio is often cumbersome --
%  as evidenced by the move from voicemail to text-based messaging
%  formats. However, text loses a lot of tone and
%  personality. Professionally produced voice narration is a pleasure
%  to listen to, but has traditionally been prohibitive for novices to
%  create. We present a system which uses automatic speech recognition
%  to convert waveforms into a human-friendly representation for
%  editing. Users can easily delete text, re-record audio segments, as
%  well as adjust timing. We have both qualitative and quantitative
%  results that the system results in a good user experience for novice
%  audio producers, and allows for the creation of high-quality audio
%  narration. We intend to apply the system to student-created content
%  in learning-at-scale settings.
Voice communication adds nuance and expressivity to virtual discussions, but its one-shot nature tends to discourage collaborators from utilizing it.
However, a text-based interface makes voice editing much easier, especially with recent advancements enabling live, time-aligned speech transcription.
We introduce SimpleSpeech, an easy-to-use platform for asynchronous audio communication (AAC) with novel lightweight tools for inserting content, adjusting pauses, and correcting transcript errors.
Qualitative and quantitative results suggest that novice audio producers, such as high school students, experience greater success and decreased workload when using SimpleSpeech to produce audio messages than without editing.
The linguistic formality of voice comments was also studied, and found to form a middle ground between oral and written communication media.
When applied to appropriate contexts such as online learning at-scale, SimpleSpeech could serve the crucial purpose of lowering the barrier to engage in audio-based collaborative environments.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
