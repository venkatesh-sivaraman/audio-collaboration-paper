\section{Introduction}

Asynchronous audio communication (AAC) is rapidly becoming available to mass audiences through social platforms such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook. 
While text is still by far the most prevalent mode of communication on the Internet, audio is desirable in many situations because it allows users to deliver more expressive, nuanced messages than text.
AAC holds considerable potential for improving collaboration in education and business as well. 
For instance, audio messages can be used as annotations on virtual documents, enabling the user to process comments aurally without visual distraction \cite{yoon}.
Another area of benefit is in online education, where voice communication has been shown to improve student-student and student-instructor engagement as well as a sense of the instructor's social presence \cite{ice,oomen,tu}. 

The problem with replacing textual communication with speech, however, is that speakers may face difficulty articulating their ideas vocally.
For instance, a 2002 study using Wimba voice boards for discussion forums found that students overwhelmingly preferred text over speech comments, in part because it required them to speak fluently without making errors \cite{wimba}.
Since this problem affects students even in physical classrooms, it could certainly prevent some learners from participating in online oral discussions.
AAC platforms in such situations, then, must somehow compensate for the linearity and immutability of audio on the production side.

Our solution is to provide lightweight, easy-to-use editing tools based on automatic speech recognition (ASR)-generated transcripts.
Many prior studies have utilized transcription to assist in audio editing \cite{casares,rubin,whittaker_semantic}, but only recently has fast, live editing become possible through advances in ASR technology \cite{baker,saon}.
We designed and developed an audio production tool, which we call SimpleSpeech, that allows users to delete and insert segments of the recording by manipulating a tokenized text representation. 
Our user interface design focuses primarily on simplifying word-level editing, an approach that is shown to be successful in the context of an online forum discussion.

A summative evaluation showed that mental workload experienced by high school students recording voice messages was shown to be significantly decreased with editing functionality, indicating that SimpleSpeech is a valuable enhancement to online audio communication platforms.
In addition, some linguistic characteristics of messages created using AAC are discussed with comparison to other forms of computer-mediated communication, leading to new considerations and insights on optimal applications of this technology.
